# Spectrum-Mill-Quality-Metrics-Viewer
R script to parse useful information from Spectrum Mill Quality Metrics output

Spectrum Mill Mass Spectrometry Software produces a highly useful output called Quality Metrics (QM). This data contains quite a few number of important parameters that can be diagnostic for the underlying quality of the mass spectrometry data obtained from a given LC-MS/MS run.

#Purpose of this R script

QM has a particular format which is long (large number of columns) and time-consuming to browse and extract the relevant information. I produced this script to rapidly generate a table that presents some of the most frequently inspected parameters.
